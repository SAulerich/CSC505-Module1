# Writing a script that converts Kilometers to Miles
kilometers = float(input("Enter distance in kilomteres: "))

# Converting to miles (1 Km = 0.6213)
miles = kilometers * 0.6213

# Output the results
print(f"[kilometers] km = [miles] mi") # Used the wrong brackets which does not pull the information from the previous lines
